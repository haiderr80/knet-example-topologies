    name : Tree Topology
    version: 1.0
    description: |
      This topology consists of 8 nodes, and 7 switches. This topology
      forms a binary tree with depth 3. Root Switch is S1. Second level
      switches are S2 and S5. Third level switches are S3, S4, S6, S7.  
      Nodes are connected to switches S3, S4, S6  and S7.
