Topology:
    name : Simple Routing Topology with two Routers
    version: 1.1
    description: |
      This topology consists of 4 nodes, and two switches,two routers . 
      nodes a1,a2,Router R1 connected to Switch1.  a3,a4 , Router R2 connnected to Switch2.
      Router R1 & R2 are connected
    controller:
      url: tcp:0.0.0.0:6633
